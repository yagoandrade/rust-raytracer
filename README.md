# Rust Raytracer
## Overview
This repository contains a high-performance raytracer written entirely in Rust, leveraging the language's safety features and concurrency to produce stunning, photorealistic images. Implements a variety of advanced rendering techniques.

## Features
1. **Physically Based Rendering:** Uses physically accurate lighting models to simulate real-world light behavior, providing highly realistic results.
2. **Multi-threaded Rendering:** Takes advantage of Rust's powerful concurrency features, significantly speeding up the rendering process on multi-core systems.
3. **Extensible Architecture:** Designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend with new features or rendering techniques.
